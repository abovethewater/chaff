# Chaff

Chaff is a modular blogging engine designed to read a repo of articles and present them as a website

Current supported modules

* Git filesystem
* Reads Markdown

Chaff started life as a fork of [wheat][], the great blogging engine from [creationix][]
Now rewritten TDD style, with a fair bit of derivative code
